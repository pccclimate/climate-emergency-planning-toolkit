The opportunities for maximising the cooling benefits of planting should not be restricted to areas surrounding a building, but also within the fabric of the building itself. As global temperatures rise, we will need to look at whole systems approaches to reducing the risk of overheating, not just in the design and orientation of buildings themselves, but through managing the relationship between buildings and their surroundings. Green walls and roofs offer significant potential to reduce the risk of overheating, whilst also benefitting biodiversity and habitat creation. All proposals should therefore demonstrate what additional adaptation measures are included to reduce the risk of overheating."
